# Restaurant Page (Curb your appetite!)

So this is what React developers feel like ðŸ¤“. I got the chance to develop a modern Single-Page-Application using Webpack and JS ES6 Modules!

Although the design could be better, it is 100% JavaScript, baby! ðŸ˜Ž

## Resources Used

During the project, I have referred to the resources below for building the UI:

- Tailwind CSS color palette for designing a color theme: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- McDonalds Menu Items for photos in the menu.
- Google Fonts Library.

## Features

- Built using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.
- ES6 Modules bundled using Webpack 5.
- Features tabbed-view, meaning all pages are dynamically created using JavaScript.
- Built with soft colors to not tire the eyes ðŸ¤“.
- Soft, minimal design language to enable the user to just focus on the content.
